Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in tasks like code generation and debugging but struggle with understanding complex inter-dependencies in large, multi-file repositories. This research aims to address these limitations by formalizing dependencies between code edits, focusing on causal-effect relationships and logical sequencing. Using multi-agent orchestration and dependency analysis, we create a framework to enhance contextual understanding and decision-making. We evaluate its effectiveness in managing complex edits and aligning with user intent, aiming to reduce cognitive load, improve productivity, and advance AI-assisted software development.
